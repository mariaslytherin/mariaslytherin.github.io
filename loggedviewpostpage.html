                    <h1>WHAT'S THIS?</h1>
                    <p>As an outcast, Jar Jar spends much his time in the Naboo swampland. It's there that the hapless Gungan encounters a pair of Jedi as they elude enemy forces during the Trade Federation invasion of Naboo.</p>
                    <p>When Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi first met Jar Jar Binks, the Gungan had been exiled from his home city of Otoh Gunga for his repeated clumsiness. Qui-Gon sensed their meeting was the will of the Force, and took the Gungan outcast with them to Tatooine and Coruscant. Qui-Gon was right: Jar Jar would prove an exasperating but important bridge between Naboo’s human settlers and their Gungan neighbors.</p>
                    <p>When Padmé Amidala became Naboo’s senator, Jar Jar assisted her as representative. In her absence, the Gungan introduced the motion for the Senate to grant Chancellor Palpatine emergency powers in the struggle against the Separatists. Jar Jar meant well, but the measure he introduced would plunge the galaxy into the Clone Wars and help Palpatine amass enormous power.</p>
                    <p>During the Clone Wars, Jar Jar assisted Padmé with political matters, and occasionally found himself drawn into the fighting, playing a key role in struggles on planets such as Rodia, Mon Cala, Naboo and Bardotta.</p>

                        This should divide anyone reading this list into one of two groups. You’ve either seen this one a ton of times by now or it’s brand new and you’re shaking your head at the idea like Luke at the end of Empire. The basic idea behind the theory is that Jar Jar Binks, every Star Wars fan’s favorite Gungan, was secretly Force sensitive and working for the Sith. It may sound crazy at first, but the more you look into it, the more sense it begins to make. There’s a lot to this theory, but the basic gist of it centers around a few general ideas.

                        The first thing to note is how skilled Jar Jar was as a fighter. Think back to that climactic battle at the end of Phantom Menace, Jar Jar utilizes what appears to be Drunken Kung Fu to defeat the Droid Army. Jar Jar also utilizes a variety of Force moves such as enhanced Force jumps at numerous times over the course of the film.

                        Perhaps most interesting of all, Jar Jar appears to utilize the Jedi mind trick when speaking with powerful figures. Constantly making suggestions to people while waving his hands in front of them, just like a Jedi does.

                        It sounds crazy, but it actually makes Jar Jar Binks a character with a purpose, which is a miracle in itself. The original post on Reddit goes into far more detail and is definitely worth checking out.
