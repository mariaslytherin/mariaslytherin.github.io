                        This should divide anyone reading this list into one of two groups. You’ve either seen this one a ton of times by now or it’s brand new and you’re shaking your head at the idea like Luke at the end of Empire. The basic idea behind the theory is that Jar Jar Binks, every Star Wars fan’s favorite Gungan, was secretly Force sensitive and working for the Sith. It may sound crazy at first, but the more you look into it, the more sense it begins to make. There’s a lot to this theory, but the basic gist of it centers around a few general ideas.

                        The first thing to note is how skilled Jar Jar was as a fighter. Think back to that climactic battle at the end of Phantom Menace, Jar Jar utilizes what appears to be Drunken Kung Fu to defeat the Droid Army. Jar Jar also utilizes a variety of Force moves such as enhanced Force jumps at numerous times over the course of the film.

                        Perhaps most interesting of all, Jar Jar appears to utilize the Jedi mind trick when speaking with powerful figures. Constantly making suggestions to people while waving his hands in front of them, just like a Jedi does.

                        It sounds crazy, but it actually makes Jar Jar Binks a character with a purpose, which is a miracle in itself. The original post on Reddit goes into far more detail and is definitely worth checking out.
